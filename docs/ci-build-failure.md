### CI Build Failure Documentation

#### Issue Summary
The CI build fails due to the apt package manager being unable to acquire the lock on `/var/lib/apt/lists/lock`. The error encountered is:

```
E: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock. It is held by process 0
```

#### Job Reference
The issue was encountered in the GitHub Actions job:
[Job Logs](https://github.com/cheesejaguar/sopher.ai/actions/runs/16979366877/job/48135958386) (ref: 734c52954c823ba8f72a75ab2facdd58dd193016)

#### Proposed Solution
To resolve this issue, it's recommended to add a command to remove the lock file before running `apt-get update` in the Dockerfile or build script. For example:

```dockerfile
RUN rm -f /var/lib/apt/lists/lock && apt-get update ...
```

This adjustment helps to avoid build failures due to interrupted or concurrent apt operations.
