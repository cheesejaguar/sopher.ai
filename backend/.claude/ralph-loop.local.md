The goal of this project is to provide users with the ability to generate custom books on
  demand. Think of a parent who has a 12 year old daughter who really wants to read a book
  about flying dragons in a mystical faraway land with adventure and romance, teaching them
  lessons, and adjusting text to be age appropriate.  Review this project, and create a
  check-list / TODO list in a document called CHANGES.md

  Along the way be sure to write unit tests and integration tests, targeting 90% code coverage and 100% passing tests
