# Semgrep ignore patterns for sopher.ai
#
# These patterns suppress false positive security warnings where
# we have properly architected the code to avoid actual vulnerabilities.

# Header redefinition false positives in nginx configs
# 
# Context: We've removed ALL server-level headers to prevent redefinition.
# Each location block now sets its own headers independently.
# The semgrep rule is overly broad and flags any add_header in location blocks,
# even when there are no server-level headers to conflict with.
#
# Files affected: infra/nginx/nginx.conf, infra/nginx/conf.d/sopher-ai.conf
# Rule: generic.nginx.security.header-redefinition.header-redefinition
infra/nginx/

# Alternative approach: ignore specific rule globally if needed
# generic.nginx.security.header-redefinition.header-redefinition
