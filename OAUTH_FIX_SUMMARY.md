# OAuth Login Fix Summary

## Problem
In production, users were experiencing a redirect loop after successful OAuth authentication. The OAuth flow would complete successfully, but users would be redirected back to the login page instead of the main application.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Cookie Domain Mismatch**: Cookies were being set with incorrect domain configuration in production
2. **Insufficient Debug Logging**: No production-safe debug logging to troubleshoot the issue
3. **Race Condition**: Middleware checked for cookies before they were fully propagated
4. **Missing User Feedback**: No clear indication when login succeeded or failed

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Debug Logging

#### Frontend Middleware (`frontend/middleware.ts`)
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_AUTH` environment variable for production debugging
- Enhanced logging with timestamps and detailed cookie information
- Better tracking of OAuth callback redirects

#### Backend OAuth (`backend/app/routers/auth.py`, `backend/app/oauth.py`)
- Added comprehensive logging throughout OAuth flow
- Log cookie domain, security settings, and headers
- Added debug headers in development/debug mode

### 2. Fixed Cookie Handling

#### Cookie Setting (`backend/app/oauth.py`)
- Enhanced production detection using `x-forwarded-proto` header
- Fixed domain setting: use `sopher.ai` instead of `.sopher.ai` for better compatibility
- Changed SameSite from `none` to `lax` for better compatibility
- Added try-catch blocks for cookie operations
- Better handling of proxy headers (`x-forwarded-host`)

#### Frontend Cookie Verification (`frontend/app/page.tsx`)
- Increased wait time from 100ms to 500ms after OAuth callback
- Added cookie verification check with retry logic
- Better handling of OAuth success parameter

### 3. User Feedback Implementation

#### Login Page (`frontend/app/login/page.tsx`)
- Added loading state during OAuth redirect
- Display error messages from URL parameters
- Show spinner while redirecting to Google

#### Main Page (`frontend/app/page.tsx`)
- Added authentication status indicators (checking/success/failed)
- Display welcome message on successful login
- Clear error messages with appropriate icons
- Auto-redirect to login on authentication failure

### 4. Error Handling Improvements

#### Backend OAuth Callback (`backend/app/routers/auth.py`)
- Handle OAuth errors from Google gracefully
- Redirect to frontend with error parameters instead of throwing exceptions
- Better error messages for different failure scenarios

## Environment Variables Added

### Backend
- `DEBUG_AUTH`: Enable authentication debug logging
- `ENVIRONMENT`: Used for production detection

### Frontend
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_AUTH`: Enable client-side auth debug logging

## Testing Instructions

### Development Testing
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_AUTH=true` and `DEBUG_AUTH=true` in `.env`
2. Open browser developer console
3. Attempt login and watch for debug messages
4. Verify cookies are set correctly

### Production Debugging
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_AUTH=true` in production environment
2. Monitor browser console and server logs
3. Check for cookie domain and security settings
4. Verify redirect URLs match expected values

## Key Files Modified

- `frontend/middleware.ts`: Enhanced debug logging and cookie checking
- `frontend/app/page.tsx`: Added authentication status UI and verification
- `frontend/app/login/page.tsx`: Added loading states and error handling
- `backend/app/oauth.py`: Fixed cookie domain and security settings
- `backend/app/routers/auth.py`: Improved error handling and logging
- `.env.example`: Added new debug environment variables

## Deployment Notes

1. Ensure `ENVIRONMENT=production` is set in production
2. Cookie domain will automatically adjust based on host headers
3. Debug logging can be enabled temporarily via environment variables
4. Monitor logs after deployment to verify cookie setting

## Troubleshooting

If the issue persists:
1. Enable debug logging with `DEBUG_AUTH=true` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_AUTH=true`
2. Check browser developer tools for cookie presence
3. Verify `/api/backend/auth/verify` endpoint returns `authenticated: true`
4. Check that cookies have correct domain (should be `sopher.ai` in production)
5. Ensure HTTPS is properly configured (required for secure cookies)
